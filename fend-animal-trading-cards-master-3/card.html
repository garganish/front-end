			<p>Parrots are intelligent birds. They have relatively large brains,they can learn, and they can use simple tools.Because some species have the ability to make sounds like human voices and have plumages with bright colors, many species are kept as pets.The greatest diversity of parrots is found in South America and Australasia.</p>
